## About
A Pokedex aplication made with React, Typescript and Styled Components. I made this repository with the purpose to improve my skills in Typescript. It is still in development.

## What is inside?
This project uses lot of stuff as:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
# To install all dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

And run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

## Roadmap
- Implement tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- Creation and documentation of components with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- Add a search bar
- Add a pokemon's info page
- Fetch pokemon's data with pagination
- Responsive CSS
